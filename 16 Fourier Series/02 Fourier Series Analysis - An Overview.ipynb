    "# Fourier Series Analysis: An Overview\n",
    "What Fourier discovered in investigating heat-flow problems is that a periodic function can be represented by an infinite sum of sine or cosine functions that are harmonically related. In other words, the period of any trigonometric term in the infinite series is an integral multiple, or harmonic, of the fundamental period $T$ of the periodic function. Thus for periodic $F(t)$. Fourier showed that $f(t)$ can be expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{16.2}\\tag{16.2}\n",
    "f(t) = a_v + \\sum^{\\infty}_{n=1}{a_n \\cos{n \\omega_0 t} + b_n \\sin{n \\omega_0 t}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the integer sequence $1, 2, 3,\\ldots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Eq. \\ref{16.2}, $a_v, a_n, \\text{and} b_n$ are known as the __Fourier coefficients__ and are calculated from $f(t)$. The term $\\omega_0$ (which equals $2\\pi/T$) represents the __fundamental frequency__ of the periodic function $f(t)$. The integral multiples of $\\omega_0$&mdash;that is, $2\\omega_0, 3\\omega_0, 4\\omega_0$, and so on&mdash;are kown as the __harmonic frequences__ of $f(t)$. Thus $2\\omega_0$ is the second harmonic, $3\\omega_0$ is the third harmonic, and $n\\omega_0$ is the $n$th harmonic of $f(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss the determination of the Fourier coefficents in Section 16.2. Before pursuing the details of using a Fourier series in circuit analysis, we first need to look at the process in general terms. From an applications point of view, we can express all the periodic functions of interest in terms of a Fourier series. Mathematically, the conditions on a periodic function $f(t)$ that ensure expressing $f(t)$ as a convergent Fourier series (known as __Dirichlet's conditions__) are that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $f(t)$ be single-valued\n",
    "2. $f(t)$ have a finite number of discontinuities in the periodic interval\n",
    "3. $f(t)$ have a finite number of maxima and minima in the periodic interval\n",
    "4. the integral\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\int^{t_0+T}_{t_0}\\left|f(t)\\right|\\,dx\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "exists\n",
    "\n",
    "Any periodic function generated by a physically realiable source satisfies Dirichlet's conditions. These are __sufficient__ conditions, not __necessary__ conditions. Thus if $f(t)$ meets these requirements, we know that we can express it as a Fourier series. However, if $f(t)$ des not meet these requirements, we still may be able to express it as a Fourier series. The necessary conditions on $f(t)$ are not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have determined $f(t)$ and calculated the Fourier coefficients ($a_v, a_n, \\text{ and } b_n$), we resolve the periodic source into a dc source ($a_v$) plus a sum of sinusoidal sources ($a_n$ and $b_n$). Because the periodic source is driving a linear circuit, we may use the principle of superposition to find the steady-state response. In particular, we first calculate the response to each source generated bythe Fourier series representation of $f(t)$ and then add the individual responses to obtain the total response. The steady-state response owing to a specific sinusoidal source is most easily found with the phasor method of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is straighforward and involves no new techniques of circuit analysis. It produces the Fourier series representation of the steady-state response; consequently, the actual shape of the response is unknown. Furthermore, the response waveform can be estimated only by adding a sufficient number of terms together. Even though the Fourier series approach to finding the steady-state response does have some drawbacks, it introduces a way of thinking aobut a problem that is as important as getting quantitative results. In fact, the conceptual picture is even more important in some respects than the quantitiative one."
